<font color=Blue size=6>How do we help clients achieve automated U.S. stock trading?</font>

## 1. All trades are day trades, with all securities closed out before the market closes, eliminating the risks associated with long-term stock holding.
## We have 100% confidence in achieving stable and reliable profits through automated day trading programs while avoiding the potential risks of long-term holdings.
## Our philosophy is: money that can be earned in 1-2 hours should not take 3-5 hours; money that can be earned in 1 day should not take a week or even a month.
## 2. The intelligent stock scanning system selects potentially volatile stocks.
## Our intelligent scanning system combines financial and company news with stock technical indicators to select or recommend 1-50 potentially volatile stocks and set up hedging strategies for day trading.
## 3. All day trades are executed by computer programs, with buying, selling, take-profit, and stop-loss settings pre-configured.
## The timeliness, accuracy, and discipline of computer-executed trades eliminate all weaknesses of manual trading, such as delays and emotional decisions.
## 4. Since we do not involve long-term stock holding, our profit rate calculation is very straightforward, as follows:
Daily profit rate % = (Account balance after market close - Account balance before market open) / Account balance before market open (assuming all available funds are used for day trading).

<font color=Blue size=6>Why can we promise an average daily profit rate above +0.5%, or even above +1%?</font>

# The main methods for investors to control trading risks and improve trading stability include diversification, implementing stop-loss strategies, controlling trade size, and avoiding emotional trading. The advent of computer trading and AI has made these methods and strategies operationally feasible:

## 1.Our robotic program can simultaneously execute buying, selling, and managing 10, 20, or even over 50 stocks within a single day without human intervention. This diversification significantly reduces the risks of day trading.
## 2.Every automated trade has pre-set take-profit and stop-loss points. In the fast-changing intraday market, once these points are triggered, the computer can promptly and accurately execute the take-profit or stop-loss.
## 3.The robotic program for automated trading perfectly avoids emotional trading, overcoming the greatest enemy of trading—human greed and fear.
## 4.The robotic program can precisely control trade size: when the intraday market is strongly bullish, most pre-set buy orders are automatically activated, scaling up the trade size; when the market is stable or declining, most pre-set buy orders are not triggered, automatically reducing the trade size.

<font color=Blue size=6>How do we provide services to you?</font>

# Our stock brokerage service is entirely based on the client's own account, eliminating any risk of illegal access, transfer, or fraud.

## The client personally opens a stock trading account with Charles Schwab.
## The client personally opens a bank account with a U.S.-based bank, with recommendations such as East West Bank or Wise.
## The client personally deposits and manages funds in their own account, without needing to transfer funds to any account not owned by the client.
## The client personally completes the transfer of funds from the bank account to the stock trading account and authorizes us to use the trading system of the stock account. After this, we can begin providing automated computer-based stock trading services (or stock operation services) for the client.
## We charge a certain percentage of the profits as a service commission, with the specific commission rate depending on the amount of funds in your stock account, ranging, for example, from 15% to 30%. Larger-scale clients can enjoy relatively discounted commission rates.



<font color=Blue size=6>We emphasize again that we only have permission to execute buy and sell operations in the stock account and have no access to deposit, withdrawal, or transfer permissions, ensuring 100% safety of the client’s funds.</font>
