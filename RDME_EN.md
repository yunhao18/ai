<font color=Blue size=6>How do we help clients achieve automated U.S. stock trading?</font>

### 1. All trades are day trades, with all securities closed out before the market closes, eliminating the risks associated with long-term stock holding.</p>
### We have 100% confidence in achieving stable and reliable profits through automated day trading programs while avoiding the potential risks of long-term holdings.
### Our philosophy is: money that can be earned in 1-2 hours should not take 3-5 hours; money that can be earned in 1 day should not take a week or even a month.
## 2. The intelligent stock scanning system selects potentially volatile stocks.
### Our intelligent scanning system combines financial and company news with stock technical indicators to select or recommend 1-50 potentially volatile stocks and set up hedging strategies for day trading.
## 3. All day trades are executed by computer programs, with buying, selling, take-profit, and stop-loss settings pre-configured.
### The timeliness, accuracy, and discipline of computer-executed trades eliminate all weaknesses of manual trading, such as delays and emotional decisions.
## 4. Since we do not involve long-term stock holding, our profit rate calculation is very straightforward, as follows:</p>
### Daily profit rate % = (Account balance after market close - Account balance before market open) /Account balance before market open (assuming all available funds are used for day trading).

<font color=Blue size=4>Why can we promise an average daily profit rate above +0.5%, or even above +1%?</font>

## The main methods for investors to control trading risks and improve trading stability include diversification, implementing stop-loss strategies, controlling trade size, and avoiding emotional trading. The advent of computer trading and AI has made these methods and strategies operationally feasible:

### 1. Our robotic program can simultaneously execute buying, selling, and managing 10, 20, or even over 50 stocks within a single day without human intervention. This diversification significantly reduces the risks of day trading.

### 2. Every automated trade has pre-set take-profit and stop-loss points. In the fast-changing intraday market, once these points are triggered, the computer can promptly and accurately execute the take-profit or stop-loss.

### 3. The robotic program for automated trading perfectly avoids emotional trading, overcoming the greatest enemy of trading—human greed and fear.

### 4. The robotic program can precisely control trade size: when the intraday market is strongly bullish, most pre-set buy orders are automatically activated, scaling up the trade size; when the market is stable or declining, most pre-set buy orders are not triggered, automatically reducing the trade size.
